<p class="paragraph-one">
  Noodles, a staple food in many Asian countries, are known for their convenience, 
  taste, and affordability. They are low in calories, making them a suitable choice 
  for those mindful of their caloric intake. Noodles are a source of essential 
  nutrients such as Selenium, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B9, Carbohydrates, and Vitamin B3.
</p>

<p class="paragraph-two">
  Moreover, noodles made from a range of materials can promote fiber and protein 
  intake. Manufacturers have responded to consumer demand for high-fiber foods by 
  producing noodles with high-fiber ingredients.
</p>
  
<p class="paragraph-three">
  However, its important to note that while noodles provide some nutritional 
  benefits, they should be consumed as part of a balanced diet. Enjoy your noodle 
  journey!
